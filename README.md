# Step 2: Add sections to the README.md file
echo "## Project Overview" 
echo "This project leverages advanced machine learning models such as GRU, LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost to forecast Bitcoin prices. By integrating sentiment analysis from social media and news, it aims to enhance predictive accuracy and provide insights into market trends." 

echo "## Features" 
echo "- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Extracted Bitcoin price data and sentiment scores." 
echo "- **Feature Engineering**: Created lagged features, rolling averages, and sentiment-price interaction terms." 
echo "- **Model Implementation**:" 
echo "  - ARIMA: Captures linear trends." 
echo "  - LSTM and GRU: Learn sequential dependencies." 
echo "  - XGBoost: Handles non-linear feature interactions." 
echo "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Captures market sentiment to improve forecasting." 
echo "- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and R² for performance comparison."

echo "## Installation and Dependencies" 
echo "- **Python**: Version 3.8 or above"
echo "- Required Libraries:"
echo "  - \`numpy\`" 
echo "  - \`pandas\`" 
echo "  - \`matplotlib\`" 
echo "  - \`scikit-learn\`" 
echo "  - \`tensorflow\` (for GRU and LSTM)"
echo "  - \`xgboost\`"
echo "  - \`statsmodels\` (for ARIMA)"

echo "## Usage" 
echo "1. **Data Preprocessing**: removing of null values to prepare the dataset." 
echo "2. **Feature Engineering**: added features for btc price and sentiment data to interpret the results in much many ways."
echo "3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train models after splitting the data into train and test ."
echo "4. **Forecast Visualization**: using libraries like matplotlib,plotly,seaborn,will help us to generate visuals for better understanding."

echo "## Results" 
echo "XGBoost outperformed other models with an R² of 0.97 and a low RMSE. Sentiment features enhanced short-term prediction accuracy." 

echo "## Future Work"
echo "- Real-time sentiment analysis."
echo "- Testing models on other cryptocurrencies." 
echo "- Exploring hybrid models for improved accuracy."
