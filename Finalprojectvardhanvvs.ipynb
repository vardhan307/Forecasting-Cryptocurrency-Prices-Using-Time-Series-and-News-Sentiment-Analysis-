        "A specific kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called long short-term memory (LSTM) is made to represent sequential data and identify long-term dependencies. By employing a gated architecture that controls the information flow through three crucial gates—the forget gate, input gate, and output gate—LSTMs, in contrast to conventional RNNs, solve the issue of vanishing and bursting gradients. These gates assist LSTMs in eliminating superfluous data and retaining important information over lengthy sequences. LSTMs are perfect for tasks like Bitcoin price predictions because of their exceptional efficacy in handling time series data. They can forecast future values based on historical data because they can learn intricate, non-linear patterns and temporal correlations.\n"
